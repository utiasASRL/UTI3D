### University of Toronto Indoor 3D Dataset

This is the homepage for University of Toronto Indoor 3D Dataset (UTIn3D). A robot navigation dataset in crowded indoor environment.

It includes the lidar frames, their localization computed by our ICP based algorithm PointMap, and the labels provided by our automated annotation approach.
