This repository contains the implementation of **Kernel Point Convolution** (KPConv) in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

KPConv is also available in [Tensorflow](https://github.com/HuguesTHOMAS/KPConv) (original but older implementation).

Another implementation of KPConv is available in [PyTorch-Points-3D](https://github.com/nicolas-chaulet/torch-points3d)
 
KPConv is a point convolution operator presented in our ICCV2019 paper ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.08889)). If you find our work useful in your
